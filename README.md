 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Text Preprocessing Project

This project is part of my journey to upskill in Machine Learning, where I focused on learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) through 
**Krish Naik's YouTube tutorials**.



📚 What I Learned

 🧾 Basics of NLP
- 📌 **Structured vs Unstructured Data**  
- 🧠 Use cases of unstructured data (e.g., tweets, chats, reviews, etc.)
- 🎯 Why NLP is essential in understanding human language in machines

 🛠 Tools Explored
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) – Natural Language Toolkit
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) – Used in scientific computing
- Python libraries like `re`, `pandas`, `nltk`



 🔄 NLP Workflow

✅ Step 1: **Text Preprocessing**
Completed all major preprocessing steps:

| Step                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lowercasing         | Convert all text to lowercase                                               |
| Removing Punctuation| Removed all special characters and digits                                   |
| Stopword Removal    | Removed common words using NLTK's stopword list                             |
| Tokenization        | Split text into individual words using `nltk.word_tokenize()`              |
| Stemming            | Reduced words to their base form (with PorterStemmer)                      |
| Lemmatization       | Reduced words to meaningful base form using `WordNetLemmatizer`            |

🚫 Demerits of Stemming
- Words like `running` → `run`, but `better` → `better` (no change)
- Sometimes loses actual meaning
- ❗ Solution: Use **Lemmatization** for better results
